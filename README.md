### Theme: [Website for a cultural events venue](https://tsaweb.org/competitions-programs/tsa/themes-problems)

#### Context: Traditionally, cultural events are held in-person. Websites for in-person venues include event information and ticket sales. Due to the global pandemic, venues have had to find new ways to meet their audiencesâ€™ needs.

#### Challenge: Develop a website for a cultural events venue that could be virtual only. Strive to develop a website that is interactive, engaging, graphically interesting, and easy to understand and navigate. Advertise the venue to potential customers who want to experience a cultural event through a virtual experience.
